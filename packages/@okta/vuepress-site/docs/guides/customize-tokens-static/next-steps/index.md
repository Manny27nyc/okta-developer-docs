* [Add a custom claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/main/#add-a-custom-claim-to-a-token)
* [Include App-specific information in a custom claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/main/#include-app-specific-information-in-a-custom-claim)
* [Customize tokens with a Groups claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-groups-claim/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a dynamic allow list](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/)
