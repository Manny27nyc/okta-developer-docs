After you create the OktaOidcStateManager instance, make sure that the user is signed in:

```swift
if let accessToken = authStateManager?.accessToken {
    // use accessToken
}
```

The `accessToken` property returns `nil` if the token is expired. See [Keep the user signed in](#keep-the-user-signed-in) to understand how to get a fresh access token.
